as.qi                   Generic Method for Converting Various Objects
                        into 'qi' Objects 'qi' objects are list-style
                        objects used by the 'summarize' function to
                        compute simple summaries about the simulated
                        data. For readability and and simplicity
                        purposes, the 'qi' function typically returns a
                        list of named simulations. This list is
                        converted internally by Zelig into a 'qi'
                        object so that several methods can be easily
                        applied to the Quantities of Interest: plot,

                        4/4/2011). Eventually this feature should be

sim                     Generic Method for Computing and Organizing
                        Simulated Quantities of Interest Simulate
                        quantities of interest from the estimated model
                        output from 'zelig()' given specified values of
                        explanatory variables established in 'setx()'.
                        For classical _maximum likelihood_ models,
                        'sim()' uses asymptotic normal approximation to
                        the log-likelihood. For _Bayesian models_,
                        Zelig simulates quantities of interest from the
                        posterior density, whenever possible.  For
                        _robust Bayesian models_, simulations are drawn
                        from the identified class of Bayesian
                        posteriors. Alternatively, you may generate
                        quantities of interest using bootstrapped
                        parameters.
